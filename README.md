# Lodash Implementation


## General Information

In this project I've implemented 10 methods from the widely-popular [lodash.js](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10/) 
library which provides many methods that add new functionality for numbers, 
strings, objects, and arrays.

All of the tests, available in `test` folder, were provided by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/).
The actual implementation of the method, codes within `_.js` file, were done by 
[me](https://github.com/rzvl).
